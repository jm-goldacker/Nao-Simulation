# Nao-Simulation

This software simulates the robot Nao, which is built by Aldebaran Robotics. 
The project was my assignment for a university lesson, which has the goals to teach software design patterns and the process of software development. 

You can find the documentation of this software with all design decisions inside `docs`.

Please consider `INSTALL.md` for installation instructions.
